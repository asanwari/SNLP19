Politics is the way that people living in groups make decisions.
Politics is about making agreements between people so that they can live together in groups such as tribes, cities, or countries.
In large groups, such as countries, some people may spend a lot of their time making such agreements.
These people are called politicians.
Politicians, and sometimes other people, may get together to form a government.
The study of politics in universities is called political science, political studies, or public administration.
In everyday life, the term "politics" refers to the way that countries are governed, and to the ways that governments make rules and laws.
Politics can also be seen in other groups, such as in companies, clubs, schools, and churches.
The government  tries to lead the whole group.
Governments do things such as:
One of the ways the government leads the group is by making laws and rules which tell everybody what they can and can not do.
The government makes these laws so that society will be safe and well-ordered.
The law that "you must not drink alcohol while driving a car" stops people from drunk driving, which could kill people.
The law "you must wear a helmet on a motorcycle" makes sure that people protect themselves
The government can also control people and what happens in a country in other ways besides making laws.
Politics is often compared to ethics (ideas about right and wrong).
Ethics is a more abstract study of right and wrong.
Ethics is usually more concerned with principle than law or politics or diplomacy, so many people think ethics is not practical.
But without some agreement on ethics, there is probably no way to even have a debate, laws or an election.
There is always some agreement on ethics and personal conduct in a political system.
In most countries, people have formed political parties to put forward their ideas.
There is usually some disagreement between people within a party, but they work together because they feel that they agree on enough things, and they will have more power if they join together.
They agree to take the same position on many issues, and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.
An election is usually a competition between different parties.
Some examples of parties are the Liberal party, the Labor party and the Greens.
The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote that humans are a political animal and that ethics and politics are closely linked.
Niccolò Machiavelli wrote, in his 1532 book, The Prince, that politics was firstly about having and keeping power.
He said that without power, a leader could do nothing.
In 1651, Thomas Hobbes wrote Leviathan, a book about politics.
Hobbes wrote that people living in groups often give up some of their rights in exchange for some protections from a government.
In the 1800s, John Stuart Mill developed the "liberal" idea of politics.
Mill said that democracy is the most important political development of the 1800s.
He said that there should be more protection for individual rights against the government.
Bernard Crick wrote a list of the political virtues, which were about best practices of politics itself.
There are also disagreements between different countries.
Attempts to solve the problem with meetings are called diplomacy.
This is politics between nations instead of politics within nations.
If the problems are not resolved by diplomatic meetings they can lead to war or terrorism.
The military is the group or groups of people that are given power to defend something (mostly a country).
They are armed, so they are called the armed forces.
The military protects its country by defending it from the armed forces of enemies, if there is a war.
The military can also be ordered by the government of the country to attack another country.
The word "military" comes from Latin miles, warrior.
There are many jobs to do in a military.
Some jobs are for fighting and some are for other work to support the military.
Some things people do in the military are use weapons, drive vehicles, and repair weapons.
Other people in the military learn how to fly aircraft, pilot ships, or repair engines.
People in the military usually wear clothes called a uniform.
In some places, especially where there may be combat, a uniform often comes in a camouflage pattern which is designed to make the person hard to see in the forest or desert.
There are two ways to join the military.
In many countries, people join the military because they want to.
In other countries, there are laws that some people have to be in the military, even if they do not want to be.
This is called the draft or conscription.
It usually depends on age and physical fitness.
People who have been in the military but have left or retired are called “veterans”.
People who have been in military and now work in civilian life, but are ready be called back to service, are called reservists.
The military of a country is usually divided into different branches organizations that do different kinds of work.
These branches usually are:
Sometimes the military has more branches that do more specialized work.
For example, in the United States and United Kingdom there are:
Some big countries even have small units which perform special actions which are very difficult.
They are called special forces.
There are also mercenaries, soldiers who fight just for pay and have little loyalty to whomever might hire them, and private military contractors (PMC), which are under the command of a company (civilian company).
The Medieval Italian condottieri were a historical example of PMCs.
A warlord may have a private army, which are often no more trustworthy than common gangsters or criminals.
In most countries of the world, young men and (in a few countries) women between 17 and 18 and of good health may be forced by the government of their country to join the military and have military training.
This is called "conscription".
The countries that do not have conscription include Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, France, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
In some countries, such as Argentina and United States, conscription is legal, but is not used, at the present time.
When a person wants to join the military as a volunteer, they "enlist".
(This means simply that they put their name on a list.)
They have to be above a certain age, 17 or 18 in most countries.
They have to pass physical fitness tests to show that they are well enough to do the jobs that they will have to do.
They must also have good enough hearing, to hear orders, and good enough sight to use a rifle.
New people in the military are often called “recruits”.
They have training at a special camp, sometimes called “boot camp" or "basic training".
During this training, the recruits usually have very little free time.
They learn to understand the "orders" or "commands" that are given by the officers to the "troops".
(The troops are the military people in a group.)
They learn the right ways to obey the orders.
They do a lot of exercise to improve their fitness and strength.
They learn about weapons, first aid, and their uniforms and "kit".
(Their kit is their equipment.)
Recruits also learn how to march.
(This is the way to walk together, keeping "in step".)
Learning to march is sometimes called “drill”.
By the time soldiers finish "boot camp", they should know enough to be a helpful person in their group.
The camp usually finishes with a parade in which the newly trained recruits show off their marching and other skills they have learned in front of important visitors.
Once the recruits are fully trained, they are ready to defend (protect) their country from attack, or to go to war, if necessary.
Copyright is a law that gives the owner of a work (like a book, movie, picture, song or website) the right to say how other people can use it.
Copyright laws make it easier for authors to make money by selling their works.
It is one part of a group of laws about intellectual property (the others being trademark and patent law).
With copyright, a work can only be copied if the owner gives permission.
If someone copies a work without permission, the owner can say they infringed their copyright.
When this happens, the owner may sue for the amount that should have been paid.
Most cases are handled by civil law.
In more serious cases, a person who copies a work that is protected under copyright could be arrested, fined or even go to prison.
Copyright was originally made for books.
Before printing presses were made, books could only be copied by hand, which would take a while to do.
But when printing presses were made, books could be copied faster and easier.
Because of this, some books were copied by people who did not own the book themselves.
So lawmakers gave owners the right to copy.
Because technology got better over time, copyright began to cover other things people could make like pictures, sound, and film.
In most countries, authors automatically own the copyright to any work they make or create, as long as they do not give the copyright to someone else.
In most countries, there is no need to register the copyright, and some countries do not even have procedures to register copyrights.
But, where registration is available, many authors register anyway, especially for works that are sold for money.
That is because registration helps to prove that the copyright of a work belongs to a certain author.
If an author gets paid to make a work for someone else, the person who pays for making the work (for example, the author's employer) will often get to own the copyright instead of the author him/herself.
For example, if a person working for a company like Microsoft creates a new computer software program at work, the Microsoft company would own the copyright.
Copyright laws usually protect owners of copyright beyond their lifetime.
In some countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, works are protected for 50 years after the author dies.
In other countries, like the United States and the United Kingdom, the protection lasts for 70 years after death.
[1] When the period of copyright protection has ended, the written document, musical composition, book, picture, or other creative work is in the public domain.
This means that no one owns the copyright and everyone is free to copy, use and change them without having to ask for permission or pay the owner.
There is an exception to the rules of copyright, called fair use.
This means that people can copy a very small amount of a work to use in reviews or in research reports.
An example of fair use is when newspaper writers quote several sentences from a copyright-protected document to tell the story.
Another example of "fair use" is when a university professor quotes several sentences from a copyright-protected book in a review of the book, or in a research report.
Different countries have different copyright laws.
Most of the differences are about:
Because of these differences, a certain piece of work may be under copyright in one country, and in the public domain in another.
Some people argue that copyright laws make it easier for people to make new works and think of new ideas.
After all, if authors get to make money for the time, effort and money they put in, then they will want to make more works later, and make more money.
But others believe that copyright laws make it harder to be creative.
Without copyright, other people could reuse existing work, and copyright law often stops that.
If an author wants to sell a work, it's often easiest to give the copyright to a publisher.
The publisher will do all the selling, and in return for that service, will keep part of the money.
But the publisher has many different things to sell, and they may not want to sell the work the author made.
Authors often find it very hard to find a publisher willing to sell their work.
But without a publisher, it can be even harder for an author to sell his or her work.
In many markets, a few big publishers own the copyrights to almost everything available, and stores will not want to sell works published by small authors themselves.
Many people say copyright law helps big publishers stay in control, and keeps smaller authors out of the market.
(tragedy of the anticommons).
As a solution to these problems, groups of authors have come up with the idea of open content.
With open content, authors give everyone permission to copy, change and give away or sell their works, as long as they follow certain rules.
These rules are explained in an open content license.
Some possible open content rules are:
The term for Open Content is sometimes called Copyleft.
A government is a group of people that have the power to rule in a territory, according to the law.
This territory may be a country, a state or province within a country, or a region.
Plato listed five kinds of government in The Republic:
The most common type of government in the Western world is called democracy.
In democracies, people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer.
The people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on legislatures such as the Parliament or Congress.
Political parties are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed.
Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems.
Democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people.
However, many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters.
One of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament, or limit the parties access to mass media such as television.
Another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power.
Few countries are textbook democracies, and the differences between them has been much studied.
[1][2][3]
A monarchy is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family, which is often called the "royal family."
There are two types of monarchies: absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies.
In an absolute monarchy, the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers.
In a constitutional monarchy a ruler's powers are limited by a document called a constitution.
In modern times, monarchies still exist in Great Britain and the Commonwealth, the Netherlands, Spain, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand, along with several other countries.
A monarch may have one of several titles: King or Queen, Emperor or Empress, or Emir.
An aristocracy is a government run by the people of a ruling class, usually people who come from wealthy families, families with a particular set of values, or people who come from a particular place.
A person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat.
Aristocracy is different from nobility, in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule, an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule, or that rulers be chosen in a different manner.
Under a dictatorship, the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country.
Originally, the Roman Republic made dictators to lead during time of war.
The Roman dictators (and Greek tyrants) were not always cruel or unkind, but they did hold on to power all by themselves, rather than sharing power with the people.
The Roman dictators only held power for a short period of time.
In modern times, a dictator's rule is not stopped by any laws, constitutions, or other social and political institutions, and can last many years or even decades.
After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by dictators.
Examples of dictators include Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Augusto Pinochet,  Idi Amin, Muammar al-Qaddafi, and Gamal Abdul Nasser.
The rules of these dictators continued from when they took power until when they died, because they would not allow any other person or law to take power from them.
There is no evidence of a woman serving as a dictator in modern times.
An oligarchy is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people.
These people may spread power equally or not equally.
An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things.
An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son.
An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler, but several powerful people.
Some past examples of oligarchy are the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and Apartheid South Africa.
A fictional example is the dystopian society of Oceania in the book Nineteen Eighty-Four.
Some critics of representative democracy think of the United States as an oligarchy.
This view is shared by anarchists.
The simplest idea of government is those who rule over people and land.
This may be as small as a community or village or as big as a continent (like Australia and India).
The people who rule can allow others to own land.
It is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe.
Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission.
This view is called libertarianism.
Others think they can do without government.
This view is called anarchism.
Almost every place on Earth is connected to one and only one government.
Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules, small border disputed areas and the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there.
For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims 'sovereign control' over it.
The word "sovereign" is old and means "control by a King" (sovereign).
Governments of villages, cities, counties and other communities are subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist, and then to that of the country.
It is from Kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation states came.
The capital of a country, for instance, is where the King kept his assets.
From this we get the modern idea of capital in economics.
A government may regulate trade as well as to rule over land.
Governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish.
In  many countries, there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs which are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them.
Tax is how government is paid for in most countries.
People who buy, sell, import, invest, own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government.
There are many theories of how to organize government better.
These are called theories of civics.
Many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy.
That way, they can be replaced at election.
Many governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power.
There are many theories of how to run a government better, and keep people from hurting each other.
These theories are part of politics.
Law is a set of rules decided by a particular state meant for the purpose of keeping the peace and security of society.
Courts or police may enforce this system of rules and punish people who break the laws, such as by paying a fine, or other penalty including jail.
In ancient societies, laws were written by leaders, to set out rules on how people can live, work and do business with each other.
But many times in history when laws have been on a false basis to benefit few at the expense of society, they have resulted in conflict.
To prevent this, in most countries today, laws are written and voted on by groups of politicians in a legislature, such as a parliament or congress, elected (chosen) by the governed peoples.
Countries today have a constitution for the overall framework of society and make further laws as needed for matters of detail.
Members of society generally have enough freedom within all the legal things they can choose to do.
An activity is illegal if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws.
A legal code is a written code of laws that are enforced.
This may deal with things like police, courts, or punishments.
A lawyer, jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law.
In the United States, there are two kinds of attorneys - "transactional" attorneys who write contracts and "litigators" who go to court.
In the United Kingdom, these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively.
The Rule of Law is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on.
It limits the powers a government has, as agreed in a country's constitution.
The Rule of Law prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people.
When leaders enforce the legal code honestly, even on themselves and their friends, this is an example of the rule of law being followed.
"The rule of law", wrote the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle in 350 BC, "is better than the rule of any individual."
Culture is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws, and people also tend to trust the ideas based on family and social habits.
In many countries throughout history, religion and religious books like the Vedas, Bible or the Koran have been a major source of law.
Civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today.
Civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government.
The secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom.
In civil law governments, judges do not generally have much power, and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by Members of Parliament.
Common law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases.
It comes from England and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the British Empire, except Malta, Scotland, the U.S. state of Louisiana, and the Canadian province of Quebec.
It is also the predominant form of law in the United States, where many laws called statutes are written by Congress, but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts.
Common law had its beginnings in the Middle Ages, when King John was forced by his barons to sign a document called the Magna Carta.
Religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books.
Examples include the Jewish Halakha, Islamic Sharia, and Christian Canon law.
Until the 1700s, Sharia law was the main legal system throughout the Muslim world.
In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, the whole legal systems still base their law on Sharia law.
Islamic law is often criticised because it often has harsh penalties for crimes.
A serious criticism is the judgement of the European Court that "sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy".
[1][2][3]
The Turkish Refah Party's sharia-based "plurality of legal systems, grounded on religion" was ruled to contravene the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
The Court decided Refah's plan would "do away with the State's role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms" and "infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms, which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy".
[1]
The history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilizations.
Ancient Egyptian law developed in 3000 BC.
In 1760 BC King Hammurabi, took ancient Babylonian law and organized it, and had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace.
These laws became known as the Code of Hammurabi.
The Torah from the Old Testament is an old body of law.
It was written around 1280 BC.
It has moral rules such as the Ten Commandments, which tell people what things are not permitted.
Sometimes people try to change the law.
For example, if prostitution is illegal, they try to make it legal.
[4]
In democracies, the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature.
Examples of legislatures include the Houses of Parliament in London, the Congress in Washington, D.C., the Bundestag in Berlin, the Duma in Moscow and the Assemblée nationale in Paris.
Most legislatures have two chambers or houses, a 'lower house' and an 'upper house'.
To pass legislation, a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill in each house.
The legislature is the branch of government that writes laws, and votes on whether they will be approved.
The judiciary is a group of judges who resolve people's disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty.
In some jurisdictions the judge does not find guilt or innocence but instead directs a jury, how to interpret facts from a legal perspective, but the jury determines the facts based on evidence presented to them and finds the guilt or innocences of the charged person.
Most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts, up to a supreme authority such as the Supreme Court or the High Court.
The highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional (which go against the constitution).
The executive is the governing center of political authority.
In most democratic countries, the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature.
This group of elected people is called the cabinet.
In France, the US and Russia, the executive branch has a President which exists separately from the legislature.
The executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries.
As well, the executive usually controls the military, the police, and the bureaucracy.
The executive selects ministers, or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice.
In many jurisdictions the Head of State does not take part in the day-to-day governance of the jurisdiction and takes a largely ceremonial role.
This is the case in many Commonwealth nations where the Head of State, usually a Governor almost exclusively acts "on the advice" of the head of the Executive (e.g.
the Prime Minister, First Minister or Premier).
The primary legal role of the Head of State in these jurisdictions is to act as a check or balance against the Executive, as the Head of State has the rarely exercised power to dissolve the legislature, call elections and dismiss ministers.
The police enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law.
Bureaucrats are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government.
Bureaucrats work within a system of rules, and they make their decisions in writing.
Lawyers are people who have learned about laws.
Lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in court.
To become a lawyer, a person has to complete a two- or three-year university program at a law school and pass an entrance examination.
Lawyers work in law firms, for the government, for companies, or by themselves.
Civil society is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights.
Organizations that are part of civil society include political parties, debating clubs, trade unions, human rights organizations, newspapers and charities.
"Corporations are among the organizations that use the legal system to further their goals.
Like the others, they use means such as campaign donations and advertising to persuade people that they are right.
Corporations also engage in commerce and make new things such as automobiles, vaporisers/e-cigarettes, and Unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e.
"drones") that the old laws are not well equipped to deal with.
Corporations also makes use of a set of rules and regulations to ensure their employees remain loyal to them (usually presented in a legal contract), and that any disobedience towards these rules are considered uncivilized and therefore given grounds for immediate dismissal.
World War I (or the First World War) began on July 28, 1914 and lasted until November 11, 1918.
The war was a global war that lasted exactly four years, three months and 14 days.
Most of the fighting was in Europe, but soldiers from many other countries took part, and it changed the colonial empires of the European powers.
Before World War II began in 1939, World War I was called the Great War, the World War or the 'war to end all wars'.
135 countries took part in World War I, and  nearly 10 million people died while fighting.
[5]
World War I was fought by most of the countries of Europe.
The actual fighting was on many different fronts.
The Western Front was where most of the fighting between Germany and the Allies happened.
Most of the fighting here was trench warfare.
The Eastern Front was fought in Central and Eastern Europe.
Fighting here was not trench warfare but mobile warfare due to the size of the front.
Much fighting happened in the Middle Eastern Front and the Italian Front.
Fighting also took place in Africa, China, and at sea as well as in the air.
The war was ended by the signing of many different treaties, the most important being the Treaty of Versailles.
World War I was the first major war where tanks, airplanes, and submarines or (U-boats) were important weapons.
In the Black Hand organization, one person who strongly supported Serbian power sent  men to kill Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.
They all failed to kill him with grenades while he passed through a large crowd but one of these men, a Serbian student named Gavrilo Princip, shot him and his pregnant wife with a pistol.
Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia for the assassination.
Germany supported Austria-Hungary and promised full support should it come to war.
Austria-Hungary sent a July Ultimatum to Serbia, listing 10 very strict conditions, possibly because they wanted an excuse to start the war.
Serbia agreed to most of the ten things on the list, but not all of them.
Austria-Hungary then declared war on Serbia.
This quickly led to a full-scale war.
[6]  Both countries' allies became involved in the war in a matter of days.
Russia joined the war on Serbia's side because the people of Serbia were Slavic, like Russia, and the Slavic countries had agreed to help each other if they were attacked.
Since Russia is a large country it had to move soldiers closer to the war, but Germany feared that Russia's soldiers would also attack Germany.
Russia did not like Germany because of things Germany had done in the past to become stronger.
Germany declared war on Russia, and began to carry out a plan created long before to fight a war in Europe.
Because Germany is in the middle of Europe, Germany could not attack to the east towards Russia without weakening itself in the west, towards France.
Germany's plan involved quickly defeating France in the west before Russia was ready to fight, and then moving her armies to the east to face Russia.
Germany could not quickly invade France directly, because France had put a lot of forts on the border, so Germany invaded the neighboring country of Belgium to then invade France through the undefended French/Belgian border.
Great Britain then joined the war because Great Britain had agreed to help Belgium if it were ever attacked by someone else.
Soon most of Europe became involved.
Germany was allied with Austria-Hungary.
Russia was allied with Serbia.
The German government was afraid that because Austria-Hungary had attacked Serbia, Russia would attack Austria-Hungary to help Serbia.
Because of this, Germany felt it had to help Austria-Hungary by attacking Russia first, before it could attack Austria-Hungary.
The problem was that Russia was also friends with France, and the Germans thought the French might attack them to help Russia.
So the Germans decided that they could win the war if they attacked France first, and quickly.
They could mobilize very quickly.
They had a list of all the men who had to join the army, and where those men had to go, and the times of every train that would carry those men to where they would have to fight.
France was doing the same thing, but could not do it as quickly.
The Germans thought that if they attacked France first, they could 'knock France' out of the war before Russia could attack them.
Russia had a big army, but Germany thought that it would take six weeks to mobilize and a long time before they could attack the Central Powers.
That wasn't true, because the Russian Army mobilized in ten days.
Also, the Russians drove deep into Austria.
Great Britain was allied with Belgium, and became quickly involved in the war.
Britain had promised to protect Belgian neutrality.
Germany passed through Belgium to reach Paris before Russia could mobilize and open up a second front against them.
On August 4, 1914, Britain declared war against Germany in support of Belgium.
Britain had the biggest empire (it ruled over a quarter of the world).
If Germany conquered France, it might take Britain and France's colonies and become the most powerful and biggest empire in the world.
Britain was also worried about Germany's growing military power.
Germany was developing its large army into one of the most powerful in the world.
The British Army was quite small.
The British Royal Navy was the largest and best in the world, and in the 19th century that was enough to keep other naval powers from attacking.
Germany was a land power, and Britain was a sea power.
But now the Germans were building a large navy.
This was seen as a threat to Britain.
However, the decision to declare war was taken under its alliance with Belgium in the Treaty of London (1839).
The Government might have decided differently.
No-one foresaw how long the war would last, and what the terrible costs would be.
The Ottoman Empire (Turkey) went into the war because it was secretly allied to Germany and two Turkish warships manned by German Navy personnel bombarded Russian towns.
Britain also fought against Turkey because the Ottoman Empire was supporting Germany.
Britain did not have any animosity towards the Turks.
[7] However, by fighting the Turks in the Mesopotamia region (in what is now called Iraq), in the Arabian Peninsula  and other places, Britain was able to defeat them with help from the British Indian Army.
[8] Later, after the War ended, Britain was able to get some areas from the old Turkish empire which was breaking up, and to add them to the British Empire.
[8]
Greece went into the war because its leader supported the Allied cause.
Greece and Serbia had become independent, but many Greeks still lived in lands that were once Greek but were now in the Turkish Ottoman Empire.
Having recently won the Balkan Wars, the Greeks especially wanted to control other land to the north that was under Bulgarian and Turkish rule, so they declared war.
Turkey killed most of the Greek army as the Greeks tried to regain parts of Turkey.
Another war started when the Greeks bombed a train.
Turkey swept Greece back into their own territory.
From then on the Greeks never again declared war, while Turkey had one of the biggest armies in the world.
Bulgaria, like Greece and Serbia, was owned by Turkey before Bulgaria broke away from Turkey.
Bulgaria claimed a lot of Turkish land as belonging to Bulgaria.
The Serbians and Greeks felt cheated because they felt the land belonged to Greece or Serbia.
The Greeks and Serbians took back the land which angered Bulgaria and led to the country becoming allies with Turkey.
They declared war on Serbia and Greece,But Bulgaria lost this war.
Romania was on the side of the Central powers until 1916, when they were forced into the war by the Allied powers.
Most people thought the war would be short.
They thought the armies would move around quickly to attack each other and one would defeat the other without too many people getting killed.
They thought the war would be about brave soldiers — they did not understand how war had changed.
Only a few people like Lord Kitchener said that the war would take a long time.
Germany's generals had decided that the best way to defeat France was to go through Belgium using a plan called the Schlieffen Plan.
This was invented by the German Army Chief of Staff, Alfred Von Schlieffen.
They could then attack the French army at the north side and the south side at the same time.
The German Army went into Belgium on August the 4th.
On the same day, Great Britain started a war on Germany, because Britain was a friend of Belgium.
The British had said some time before, in 1839, that they would not let anyone control Belgium, and they kept their promise.
When the Germans got to the Belgian city of Liège, the Belgians fought very hard to stop them from coming into the city.
The Germans did finally push the Belgians out of the city, but it had taken longer than the German generals had planned.
Then the Germans attacked the north side of the French army.
The French and the British moved men up to fight the Germans.
They could do this because the Belgians had fought so long at Liège.
But the Germans pushed the French back at the frontiers, and the British held the Germans back at Mons, but afterwards they also fell back to join up with the retreating French army, until they were stopped at the river Marne.
This was the First Battle of the Marne or  Miracle of the Marne.
In the East, the Russians had attacked the Germans.
The Russians pushed back the Germans, but then the Germans defeated the Russians at the Battle of Tannenberg.
Trench warfare killed great numbers of soldiers.
New weapons, such as machine guns, and long-range artillery had an increased rate of fire that cut down huge numbers of soldiers during mass charges, a tactic leftover from older warfare.
The men on both sides took spades and dug holes, because they did not want to be killed.
The holes joined up into trenches, until the lines of trenches went all the way from Switzerland to the North Sea.
In front of the trenches, there was barbed wire that cut anyone who tried to climb over it, and land mines that blew up anyone who tried to cross.
Late in the war, poison gas was also an important weapon.
The new machine guns, artillery, trenches and mines made it very difficult to attack.
The generals had fought many wars without these, so they ordered their armies to attack in the old style of marching in rows- allowing the enemy to shoot them down easily.
At the Battle of the Somme in 1916 60,000 British men died in a single day.
It was one of the bloodiest days in the history of the British army.
Late in the war the British and French invented tanks and used them to attack entrenched Germans but could not make enough of them to make a big difference.
The Germans invented special Sturmabteilung tactics to infiltrate enemy positions, but they also were too little, too late.
The British used whistles to communicate to other soldiers, so before they shelled the German trenches, they would sound the whistle.
However, the Germans caught on to this tactic after a while, so after the shelling, when the British soldiers came to finish off the German soldiers, the Germans were ready with their machine guns, because they knew the British were coming.
Airplanes were first used extensively in World War I.
Airplanes were not used very much in fighting before World War I.
It was the first war to use airplanes as weapons.
Airplanes were first used for reconnaissance, to take pictures of enemy land and to direct artillery.
Generals, military leaders, were using airplanes as an important part of their attack plans at the end of the war.
World War I showed that airplanes could be important war weapons.
Airplanes in World War I were made of wood and canvas, a type of rough cloth.
They did not last for  a long time.
They could not fly very fast at the beginning of the war.
They could only fly up to 116 kilometers per hour, or 72 miles per hour.
At the end of the war they could fly up to 222 kilometers per hour, or 138 miles per hour.
But they could not fly as fast as planes today.
Guns were put on planes for the first time during the war.
Pilots, people who fly the plane, used the guns to shoot enemy planes.
One pilot used metal sheets, pieces of metal, to armor his airplane.
Other pilots began using metal sheets, too.
Pilots also made their airplanes better with machine guns, guns that shoot bullets much faster.
Machine guns made fighting harder and more dangerous between airplanes.
Pilots had to wear certain clothes when flying an airplane in World War I because they flew high where the air is cold.
The pilot's clothes kept them warm and protected them from the wind and cold.
Pilots wore a leather coat to protect their bodies.
They wore a padded helmet and goggles, large glasses with special lenses, to protect their head and face.
They wore a scarf around their neck.
The scarf kept the wind from blowing against their neck when they turned their head.
The German leaders decided to use submarines.
These submarines were named U-boats, from the German word Unterseeboot (meaning underwater boat).
The U-boats attacked passenger ships such as RMS Lusitania carrying civilians to Great Britain.
They did not follow the laws of war, because the British would be able to destroy them if they did.
America was selling weapons to Germany's enemies but not to Germany, thus not being neutral.
"Neutral" means a country is not involved in the war.
Many American and British noncombatants were killed by the submarines.
Germany also wrote a secret telegram note to Mexico in code suggesting that the two countries work together to attack the United States.
This note is called the Zimmerman Telegram because Arthur Zimmerman sent it.
It offered Mexico land in the southwestern United States that the United States took in previous wars.
Spies from the United Kingdom found out about the note and told the United States.
American people became angry and many decided that they wanted their country to enter the war against Germany.
For these and other reasons, on April 6, 1917 the United States declared war against Germany and became part of the Allies.
The defeat of Russia on the Eastern Front (World War I) caused unrest inside the Empire.
In 1917, there was a revolution in Russia.
The Tsar Nicholas II had to say he would not be Tsar any more, and that the people should have power.
At first it was thought that Russia would fight harder now that the Tsar was gone.
However, the Russian people didn't want to fight anymore, because there was not sufficient food, appropriate armament, or adequate roads to supply its army.
The war had been putting burdens on them, and many of them were poor and hungry.
They began to hate their new government because it wouldn't stop the war.
Then, there was the October Revolution.
Two factions fought to rule over Russia.
The Mensheviks lost against the Bolsheviks.
The leader of the Bolsheviks was Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924) a Communist who followed the ideas of Karl Marx.
The new government asked the Germans for peace and signed a peace treaty called Brest-Litovsk with the Central Powers in March 1918 at the city of Brest-Litovsk.
The Germans and Russians stopped fighting.
This gave Germany land in Eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea.
After the war, the Germans had to agree to the Treaty of Versailles.
Germany had to pay approximately $31.5 billion[9] in reparations.
They also had to take responsibility for the war.
Part of the treaty said the countries of the world should come together to make an international organization to stop wars from happening.
This organization was called the League of Nations.
The United States Senate didn't agree with this, even though it was the idea of the US president, Woodrow Wilson.
Woodrow Wilson tried to tell the American people that they should agree, but the United States never joined the League of Nations.
Problems with the Treaty in Germany would later lead to the Second World War.
Total Dead:
World War II (WWII or WW2), also called the Second World War and, in the Soviet Union, the Great Patriotic War, was a global war involving fighting in many parts of the world and many countries.
Most countries fought in the years 1939–1945 but some started fighting in 1937.
Most of the world's countries, including all the great powers, fought as part of two military alliances: the Allies and the Axis Powers.
World War II was the deadliest conflict in all of human history.
It involved more countries, cost more money, and killed more people than any other war in human history.
[1] Between 50 to 85 million people died.
[2][3] The majority were civilians.
It included massacres, the deliberate genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, starvation, disease, and the only use of nuclear weapons against civilians in history.
The war in Asia began when the Empire of Japan invaded China on July 7, 1937.
[4]  The United States reacted by placing an oil embargo on Japan.
The start of the war in Europe was when Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939.
France and Britain reacted by declaring war on Germany.
By 1941, much of Europe was under German control.
Only Britain remained fighting against the Axis in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic.
In June 1941, the Axis Powers invaded the Soviet Union, starting the largest area of war in history.
On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the United States and Western colonies in the Pacific and the two wars became one.
The Japanese victories were stopped in 1942, and the European Axis victories were also stopped by 1943, both in North Africa and in the Soviet Union.
After that, the Allies started to fight back from all sides.
The Axis lost North Africa and, starting in 1943, were forced to defend Italy.
[5] In 1944, the Allies invaded France, heading towards Germany on the Rhine River,[6] while the Soviets kept closing in from the East.
Germany surrendered in May 1945.
Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945.
The war ended with the Allied victory.
After the war, the United Nations was set up to develop support between countries and to prevent future wars.
The Cold War among the major winners soon started, but they did not fight each other in an actual war.
Decolonization of Asia and Africa, where those countries controlled by European countries were given their independence, happened as well.
This was because European power was weakened from the war.
Economic recovery and the political integration (the process of uniting countries) were among other results of the war.
The countries that joined the war were on one of two sides: the Axis and the Allies.
The Axis Powers at the start of the war were Germany, Italy and Japan.
There were many meetings to create the alliance between these countries.
[7][8][9][10] Finland, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Thailand joined the Axis later.
As the war continued, some Axis countries changed to join the Allies instead, such as Italy.
The Allied Powers were the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth members, France, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Belgium and China at the start of the war.
China had been fighting a civil war.
In June 1941, Germany attacked the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.
In December 1941 came Japan's Attack on Pearl Harbor against the United States.
These two large, powerful countries then joined the Allies.
World War I had greatly changed the way of diplomacy and politics in Asia, Europe, and Africa with the defeat of the Central Powers.
Empires which sided with the Central Powers were destroyed.
The Russian Empire, which did not side with the Central Powers, died as well.
The war also changed the borders in Eastern Europe, with many new countries born.
The war led to strong irredentism and revanchism.
These senses were especially strong in Germany, which had no choice but to sign the Treaty of Versailles.
[11] The Germans also had 13% of their homeland area and all colonies taken away, and they had to pay back a very large sum of money to the Allies.
[12]  The size of their army and navy was also limited,[13] while its air force was banned.
In Italy, nationalists were unhappy with the outcome of the war, thinking that their country should have gained far more territory from the past agreement with the Allies.
The fascist movement in the 1920s brought Mussolini to the leadership of the country.
He promised to make Italy a great power by creating its colonial empire.
[14]
After the Kuomintang (KMT), the governing party of China, unified the country in the 1920s, the civil war between it and its past ally Communist Party of China began.
[15] In 1931, Japan used the Mukden Incident as a reason to take Manchuria and set up its puppet state, Manchukuo,[16] while the League of Nations could not do anything to stop it.
The Tanggu Truce, a ceasefire, was signed in 1933.
In 1936, the KMT and the communists agreed to stop fighting against each other to fight Japan instead.
[17] In 1937, Japan started a Second Sino-Japanese War to take the rest of China.
[18]
After the German Empire was disestablished, the democratic Weimar Republic was set up.
There were disagreements between the Germans which involved many political ideologies, ranging from nationalism to communism.
The fascist movement in Germany rose because of the Great Depression.
Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party, became the Chancellor in 1933.
After the Reichstag fire, Hitler created a totalitarian state, where there is only one party by law.
[19] Hitler wanted to change the world order and quickly rebuilt the army, navy and air force,[20] especially after Saarland was reunited in 1935.
In March 1936, Hitler sent the army to Rhineland.
The Spanish Civil War began in July 1936.
The war ended with the nationalist victory, supported by Italy and Germany.
In March 1938, Germany sent its army into Austria, known as the Anschluss, which had only a little reaction from European countries.
[21] Shortly after that, the Allies agreed to give Sudetenland, part of Czechoslovakia, to Germany, so that Hitler would promise to stop taking more land.
[22] But the rest of the country was either forced to surrender[23] or invaded by March 1939.
[24] The Allies now tried to stop him, by promising to help Poland if it was attacked.
[25] Just before the war, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a peace agreement, agreeing that they would not attack each other for ten years.
[26] In the secret part of it, they agreed to divide Eastern Europe between them.
[27]
World War II began on September 1, 1939, as Germany invaded Poland.
On September 3, Britain, France, and the members of the Commonwealth declared war on Germany.
They could not help Poland much and only sent a small French attack on Germany from the West.
[28] The Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland soon after Germany, on September 17.
[29] Finally, Poland was divided.
Germany then signed an agreement to work together with the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union forced the Baltic countries to allow it to keep Soviet soldiers in their countries.
[30] Finland did not accept the Soviet call for its land, so it was attacked in November 1939.
[31] With peace, the world war broke out.
[32] France and Britain thought that the Soviet Union might enter the war on the side of Germany and drove the Soviet Union out of the League of Nations.
[33]
After Poland was defeated, the "Phoney War" began in Western Europe.
While British soldiers were sent to the Continent, there were no big battles fought between two sides.
[34] Then, in April 1940, Germany decided to attack Norway and Denmark so that it would be safer to transport iron ore from Sweden.
The British and French sent an army to disrupt the German occupation, but had to leave when Germany invaded France.
[35] Chamberlain was replaced by Churchill as Prime Minister of United Kingdom in May 1940 because the British were unhappy with his work.
[36]
On 10 May, Germany invaded France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg and quickly defeated them by using blitzkrieg tactics.
[37] The British were forced to leave mainland Europe at Dunkirk.
On June 10, Italy invaded France, declaring war on France and the United Kingdom.
Soon after that, France was divided into occupation zones.
One was directly controlled by Germany and Italy,[38] and the other was unoccupied Vichy France.
By June 1940, the Soviet Union moved its soldiers into the Baltic states and took them,[39] followed by Bessarabia in Romania.
Although there had been some collaboration between the Soviet Union and Germany earlier, this event made it serious.
[40][41]  Later, when the two could not agree to work more closely together, relationships between them became worse to the point of war.
[42]
Then Germany began an air battle over Britain to prepare for a landing on the island,[43] but the plan was finally canceled in September.
The German Navy destroyed many British ships transporting goods in the Atlantic.
[44]  Italy, by this time, had begun its operation in the Mediterranean.
The United States remained neutral but started to help the Allies.
By helping to protect British ships in the Atlantic, the United States found itself fighting German ships by October 1941 but this was not officially war.
[45]
In September 1940, Italy began to invade British-held Egypt.
In October, Italy invaded Greece, but it only resulted in an Italian retreat to Albania.
[46] Again, in early 1941, an Italian army was pushed from Egypt to Libya in Africa.
Germany soon helped Italy.
Under Rommel's command, by the end of April 1941, the Commonwealth army was pushed back to Egypt again.
[47] Other than North Africa, Germany also successfully invaded Greece, Yugoslavia and Crete by May.
[48] Despite these victories, Hitler decided to cancel the bombing of Britain after 11 May.
[49]
At the same time, Japan's progress in China was still not much, although the nationalist and communist Chinese began fighting each other again.
[50] Japan was planning to take over European colonies in Asia while they were weak, and the Soviet Union could feel a danger from Germany, so a non-aggression pact (which was an agreement that both countries would not attack each other) between the two was signed in April 1941.
[51] However, Germany kept preparing an attack on the Soviet Union, moving its soldiers close to the Soviet border.
[52]
On June 22, 1941, the European Axis countries attacked the Soviet Union.
During the summer, the Axis quickly captured Ukraine and the Baltic regions, which caused huge damage to the Soviets.
Britain and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance between them in July.
[53] Although there was great progress in the last two months, when winter arrived, the tired German army was forced to delay its attack just outside Moscow.
[54] It showed that the Axis had failed its main targets, while the Soviet army was still not weakened.
This marked the end of the blitzkrieg stage of the war.
[55]
By December, the Red Army facing the Axis army had received more soldiers from the east.
It began a counter-attack that pushed the German army to the west.
[56] The Axis lost a lot of soldiers but it still saved most of the land it received before.
[57]
By November 1941, the Commonwealth counter-attacked the Axis in North Africa and got all the land it lost before.
[58] However, the Axis pushed the Allies back again until stopped at El Alamein.
[59]
In Asia, German successes encouraged Japan to call for oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies.
[60] Many Western countries reacted to the occupation of French Indochina by banning oil trading with Japan.
[61] Japan planned to take over European colonies in Asia to create a great defensive area in the Pacific so that it could get more resources.
[62] But before any future invasion, it first had to destroy the American Pacific Fleet in the Pacific Ocean.
[63] On December 7, 1941, it attacked Pearl Harbor as well as many harbors in several South East Asian countries.
[64] This event led the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Western Allies and China to declare war on Japan, while the Soviet Union remained neutral.
[65] Most of the Axis nations reacted by declaring war on the United States.
By April 1942, many South East Asian countries: Burma, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, had almost fallen to the Japanese.
[66] In May 1942, the Philippines fell.
The Japanese navy had many quick victories.
But in June 1942, Japan was defeated at Midway.
Japan could not take more land after this because a large part of its navy was destroyed during the battle.
Japan then began its plan to take over Papua New Guinea again,[67] while the United States planned to attack the Solomon Islands.
The fight on Guadalcanal  began in September 1942 and involved a lot of troops and ships from both sides.
It ended with the Japanese defeat in early 1943.
[68]
On the Eastern Front, the Axis defeated Soviet attacks during summer and began its own main offensive to southern Russia along Don and Volga Rivers in June 1942, trying to take over oil fields in Caucasus and a great steppe.
Stalingrad was in the path of the Axis army, and the Soviets decided to defend the city.
By November the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad, however the Soviets were able to surround the Germans during winter[69] After heavy losses, the German army was forced to surrender the city in February 1943.
[70] Even though the front was pushed back further than it was before the summer attacks, the German army still had become dangerous to an area around Kursk.
[71]
In August 1942, because of the Allied defense at El Alamein, the Axis army failed to take the town.
A new Allied offensive, drove the Axis west across Libya a few months later,[72] just after the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa forced it to join the Allies.
[73] This led to Axis defeat in the North African Campaign May 1943.
[74]
In the Soviet Union, on July 4, 1943, Germany started an attack around Kursk.
Many German soldiers were lost because of the Soviets' well-created defenses.
[75][76] Hitler canceled the attack before any clear outcome.
[77] The Soviets then started their own counter-attack, which was one of the turning points of the war.
After this, the Soviets became the attacking force on the Eastern Front, instead of the Germans.
[78][79]
On July 9, 1943, affected by the earlier Soviet victories, the Western Allies landed on Sicily.
This resulted in the arrest of Mussolini in the same month.
[80] In September 1943, the Allies invaded mainland Italy, following the Italian armistice with the Allies.
[81] Germany then took control of Italy and disarmed its army,[82] and built up many defensive lines to slow the Allied invasion down.
[83] German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon created the German-occupied client state, Italian Social Republic.
[84]
Late in 1943 Japan conquered some islands in India and began an invasion of the Indian mainland.
The Army of India and other forces expelled them in early 1944.
In early 1944, the Soviet army drove off the German army from Leningrad,[85] ending the longest and deadliest siege in history.
After that, the Soviets began a big counter-attack.
By May, the Soviets had retaken Crimea.
With the attacks in Italy from September 1943, the Allies succeeded in capturing Rome on June 4, 1944, and made the German forces fall back.
[86]
On D-Day, June 6, 1944, the Allies began the invasion of Normandy, France.
The code name for the invasion was Operation Overlord.
The invasion was successful, and led to the defeat of the German forces in France.
Paris was freed on August 1944 and the Allies continued eastward while the German front collapsed.
Operation Market-Garden was the combined aerial invasion of the Netherlands launched on September 17, 1944.
The purpose of the invasion was to seize a series of bridges that included a bridge in Arnhem, which spanned the Rhine river.
Market was the name for the airborne invasion.
The ground invasion, named Garden, reached the Rhine river, but could not take the Arnhem bridge.
.
On June 22, the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front, codenamed Operation Bagration, almost destroyed the German Army Group Centre.
[87] Soon after, the Germans were forced to retreat and defend Ukraine and Poland.
Arriving Soviet troops caused uprisings against the German government in Eastern European countries, but these failed to succeed unless helped by the Soviets.
[88] Another Soviet offensive forced Romania and Bulgaria to join the Allies.
[89] Communist Serbs partisans under Josip Broz Tito retook Belgrade with some help from Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.
By early 1945, the Soviets attacked many German-occupied countries: Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia and Hungary.
Finland switched to the side of the Soviets and Allies.
On December 16, 1944, the Germans tried one last time to take the Western Front by attacking the Allies in Ardennes, Belgium, in a battle is known as the Battle of the Bulge.
This was the last major German attack of the war, and the Germans were not successful in their attack.
[90]
By March 1945, the Soviet army moved quickly from Vistula River in Poland to East Prussia and Vienna, while the Western Allies crossed the Rhine.
In Italy, the Allies pushed forward, while the Soviets attacked Berlin.
The allied western forces would eventually meet up with the Soviets at the Elbe river on April 25, 1945.
Hitler committed suicide on April 30, 1945, two days after Mussolini's death.
[91] In his will, he appointed his navy commander, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, to be the President of Germany.
[92]  Dönitz surrendered to the Allies, and opposed Hitler's will to have Germany continue fighting.
German forces in Italy surrendered on April 29, 1945.
Germany surrendered to the Western Allies on May 7, 1945, known as V-E Day, and was forced to surrender to the Soviets on May 8, 1945.
The final battle in Europe was ended in Italy on May 11, 1945.
[93]
In the Pacific, American forces arrived in the Philippines on June 1944.
And by April 1945, American and Philippine forces had cleared much of the Japanese forces, but the fighting continued in some parts of the Philippines until the end of the war.
[94] British and Chinese forces advanced in Northern Burma and captured Rangoon by May 3, 1945.
[95] American forces then took Iwo Jima by March and Okinawa by June 1945.
[96] Many Japanese cities were destroyed by Allied bombings, and Japanese imports were cut off by American submarines.
The Allies wanted Japan to surrender with no terms, but Japan refused.
This resulted in the United States dropping two atomic bombs over Hiroshima (August 6, 1945) and Nagasaki (August 9, 1945).
On August 8, 1945, the Soviets invaded Manchuria, quickly defeating the primary Imperial Japanese Army there.
[97] On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allies.
The surrender documents were formally signed on board the USS Missouri on September 2, 1945, ending the war.
[98]
The Allies managed to occupy Austria and Germany.
Germany was divided in half.
The Soviet Union controlled the Eastern part, and the Western Allies controlled the Western part.
The Allies began denazification, removing Nazi ideas from history,[source?]
and most high-ranking Nazis were captured and brought to a special court.
Germany lost a quarter of the land it had in 1937, with the land given to Poland and the Soviet Union.
The Soviets also took some parts of Poland[99][100][101] and Finland,[102] as well as three Baltic countries.
[103][104]
The United Nations was formed on October 24, 1945,[105] to keep peace between countries in the world.
[106] However, the relationship between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had worsened during the war[107] and, soon after the war, each power quickly built up their power over controlled area.
In Western Europe and West Germany, it was the United States, while in East Germany and Eastern Europe, it was the Soviet Union, in which many countries were turned  into Communist states.
The Cold War started after the formation of the American-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
[108]
In Asia, Japan was put under American occupation.
In 1948, Korea was divided into North and South Korea, each claiming to be the legal representative of the Koreans, which led to the Korean War in 1950.
[109] Civil war in China continued from 1946 and resulted in the KMT retreating to Taiwan in 1949.
[110] The communists won the mainland.
In the Middle East, the Arab disagreement on the United Nations plan to create Israel marked the beginning of conflicts between the Arabs and Israel.
After the war, decolonization took place in many European colonies.
[111] Bad economies and people wanting to rule themselves were the main reasons for that.
In most cases, it happened peacefully, except in some countries, such as Indochina and Algeria.
[112] In many regions, European withdrawal caused divisions among the people who had different ethnic groups or religions.
[113]
Economic recovery was different in many parts of the world.
In general, it was quite positive.
The United States became richer than any other country and, by 1950, it had taken over the world's economy.
[114][115] It also ordered the Marshall Plan (1948–1951) to help European countries.
German,[116] Italian,[117][118] and French economies recovered.
[119] However, the British economy was badly harmed[120] and continued to worsen for more than ten years.
[121] The Soviet economy grew very fast after the war was over.
[122] This also happened with the Japanese economy, which became one of the largest economies in the 1980s.
[123] China returned to the same production level as before the war by 1952.
[124]
There is no exact total number of deaths, because many were unrecorded.
Many studies said that more than 60 million people died in the war, mostly civilians.
The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people,[125] almost half of the recorded number.
[126] This means that 25% of the Soviets were killed or wounded in the war.
[127] About 85% of the total deaths were on the Allies side, and the other 15% were on the Axis.
Mostly, people died because they were sick, hungry to death, bombed, or killed because of their ethnicity.
The Nazis killed many groups of people they selected, known as The Holocaust.
They exterminated Jews, and killed the Roma, Poles, Russians, homosexuals and other groups.
[128] Around 11[129] to 17 million[130] civilians died.
Around 7.5 million people were killed in China by the Japanese.
[131] The most well-known Japanese crime is the Nanking Massacre, in which hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians were raped and murdered.
There were reports that the Germans and Japanese tested biological weapons against civilians[132] and prisoners of war.
[133]
Although many of the Axis's crimes were brought to the first international court,[134] crimes caused by the Allies were not.
Other than the Holocaust, about 12 million people, mostly Eastern Europeans, were forced to work for the German economy.
[135] German concentration camps and Soviet gulags caused a lot of death.
Both treated prisoners of war badly.
This was even the case for Soviet soldiers who survived and returned home.
Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also caused a lot of deaths.
The death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1%,[136] seven times that of prisoners under Germans and Italians.
[137] More than 10 million Chinese civilians were made slaves and had to work in mines and war factories.
[138] Between 4 and 10 million people were forced to work in Java.
[139]
Between 1942 and 1945, Roosevelt signed an order which made Japanese Americans go to internment camps.
Some Germans and Italians were included too.
The Allies agreed that the Soviet Union could use prisoners of war and civilians for forced labor.
[140] Hungarians were forced to work for the Soviet Union until 1955.
[141]
Before the war, in Europe, the Allies had a larger population and economy than the Axis.
If colonies are included, the GDP of the Allies then would be two times of that of the Axis.
[142] While in Asia, China had only 38% higher GDP than the Japanese if their colonies are counted.
[142]
The Allies' economy and population compared with the Axis' lessened with the early Axis victories.
However, this was no longer the case after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies in 1941.
The Allies were able to have a higher production level compared with the Axis because the Allies had more natural resources.
Also, Germany and Japan did not plan for a long war and had no ability to do so.
[143][144] Both tried to improve their economies by using slave laborers.
[145]
As men went off to fight, women took over many of the jobs they left behind.
At factories, women were employed to make bombs, guns, aircraft, and other equipment.
In Britain, thousands of women were sent to work on farms as part of the Land Army.
Others formed the Women's Royal Naval Service to help with building and repairing ships.
Even Princess Elizabeth, who later became Queen Elizabeth II, worked as a mechanic to aid the war effort.
By 1945 some weapons were made almost entirely by women.
In the beginning, women were rarely used in the labour forces in Germany and Japan.
[146][147] However, Allied bombings[148][149] and Germany's change to a war economy made women take a greater part.
[150]
In Britain, women also worked in gathering intelligence, at Bletchley Park and other places.
The mass evacuation of children also had a major impact on the lives of mothers during the war years.
Germany had two different ideas of how it would occupy countries.
In Western, Northern, and Central Europe, Germany set economic policies which would make it rich.
During the war, these policies brought as much as 40% of total German income.
[151] In the East, the war with the Soviet Union meant Germany could not use the land to gain resources.
The Nazis used their racial policy and murdered a lot of people they thought non-human.
The Resistance, the group of people who fought Germany secretly, could not harm the Nazis much until 1943.
[152][153]
In Asia, Japan claimed to free colonised Asian countries from European colonial powers.
[154] Although they were welcomed at first in many territories, their cruel actions turned the opinions against them within a short time.
[155] During the occupation, Japan used 4 million barrels of oil left behind by the Allies at the war's end.
By 1943, it was able to produce up to 50 million barrels of oil in the Dutch East Indies.
This was 76% of its 1940 rate.
[155]
The war brought new methods for future wars.
The air forces improved greatly in fields such as air transport,[156] strategic bombing (to use bombs to destroy industry and morale),[157] as well as radar, and weapons for destroying aircraft.
Jet aircraft were developed and would be used in worldwide air forces.
[158]
At sea, the war focused on using aircraft carriers and submarines.
Aircraft carriers soon replaced battleships.
[159][160][161] The important reason was they were cheaper.
[162] Submarines, a deadly weapon since World War I,[163] also played an important part in the war.
The British improved weapons for destroying submarines, such as sonar, while the Germans improved submarine tactics.
[164]
The style of war on the land changed from World War I to be more moveable.
Tanks, which were used to support infantry, changed to a primary weapon.
[165] The tank was improved in speed, armour and firepower during the war.
At the start of the war, most commanders thought that using better tanks was the best way to fight enemy tanks.
[166] However, early tanks could harm armour just a little.
The German idea to avoid letting tanks fight one another meant tanks facing tanks rarely happened.
This was a successful tactic used in Poland and France.
[165] Ways to destroy tanks also improved.
Even though vehicles became more used in the war, infantry remained the main part of the army,[167] and most equipped like in World War I.
[168]
Submachine guns became widely used.
They were especially used in cities and jungles.
[168]  The assault rifle, a German development combining features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the main weapon for most armies after the war.
[169]
Other developments included better encryption for secret messages, such as the German Enigma.
Another feature of military intelligence was the use of deception, especially by the Allies.
Others include the first programmable computers, modern missiles and rockets, and the atomic bombs.
Barack Hussein Obama II  (/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn oʊˈbɑːmə/ (listen); born August 4, 1961)[1] is an American politician.
He was the 44th President of the United States and the first African-American to hold the office.
He is a Democrat.
Obama won the 2008 United States presidential election, on November 4, 2008.
He was inaugurated on January 20, 2009.
As president, he slowly ended US participation in the Iraq War, having prepared the country to defend itself.
He also signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often called "Obamacare") which changed many health care laws.
He also enacted many acts to create public works jobs to help the economy.
He became the first president to openly express support for gay marriage, proposed gun control as a result of the Sandy Hook school shooting and opened diplomatic relations with Cuba.
Obama was born on August 4, 1961[2]  in Kapiʻolani Medical Center for Women and Children (called Kapiʻolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital in 1961) in Honolulu, Hawaii[3][4] and is the first President to have been born in Hawaii.
[5] His father was a black exchange student from Kenya named Barack Obama Sr.
He died in a motorcycle accident in Kenya in 1982.
His mother was a white woman from Kansas named Ann Dunham, who was an anthropologist and died in 1995.
[6] His mother married Barack Obama Sr. in 1961 and divorced him in 1964.
In 1965 his mother married a man from Indonesia named Lolo Soetoro.
She divorced him in 1980.
He spent most of his childhood in Hawaii and Chicago, Illinois, although he lived in Jakarta, Indonesia with his mother and stepfather from age 6 to age 10.
[7] He later moved back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents.
He started college at Occidental College in Los Angeles, and graduated from Columbia University in New York City.
After taking time off as a community organizer, Obama went to law school at Harvard University.
After law school, Obama worked for a law firm in Hyde Park, Chicago.
The law firm sued companies who fired people.
Obama worked for Alice Palmer, an Illinois state senator.
In 1995 she chose not to run for re-election so that she could run for U.S. Congress,[8] and Obama decided to run for her Illinois state senate seat.
Palmer lost her election for U.S. Congress, so she tried to keep her seat in the state senate, but she did not have enough time to meet the rules of the election.
Obama's team said that she could not be on the ballot, and the election rulemakers agreed.
Obama won the election and became an Illinois state senator.
[8] He was state senator from 1997 to 2004.
[9]
While he was Illinois state senator, he wrote a law that required police to keep records on the race of people they stopped.
[9] The law that he wrote also forced police to videotape when they talked to people they suspect of murder.
[9] He taught law part-time at the University of Chicago Law School.
Judge and political teacher Abner J. Mikva taught Obama politics and became his mentor.
During his early political career, Obama would make appearances and debate on Chicago Tonight.
Obama ran for the U.S.
Senate.
[10] While running for Senate, John Kerry asked him to speak at the Democratic National Convention.
He spoke on television.
He was a U.S.
Senator from 2005 to 2008.
[11]
Obama won the presidential election of 2008.
[10]
Obama's presidential campaign for the White House started in early June 2008 when he defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries.
Hillary Clinton was favored to win but Obama won many smaller state caucuses (local party elections) by having a lot of volunteers.
He decided not to accept government money for his campaign so that he could accept more private money under Campaign finance reform in the United States.
He raised the most amount of money ever for a presidential campaign.[source?]
Obama's campaign theme was that he was a man of hope and change.
He was also against the war in Iraq.
He was in favor of giving money to American car companies.
He was in favor of sending more troops to Afghanistan.
During the campaign, some people said that Obama's friends were Tony Rezko, a landlord, and former revolutionary Bill Ayers; Obama said that they were not his friends.[source?]
Obama also had trouble when his minister at church, Jeremiah Wright, was videotaped criticizing America.
During the campaign, Obama said that his opponent, Republican candidate John McCain, was just like George W. Bush, something that John McCain said was not true.
He defeated McCain in the election on November 4 by a wide electoral majority of 365 to 173, meaning that he won the most votes in enough states to send 365 people to officially elect him.
The popular vote (based on the total number of votes across the country) was closer, with Obama winning 53%, McCain 46%.
Obama has been married to Michelle Obama since 1992.
She has a law degree from Harvard Law School.
She worked as a lawyer.
They have two daughters, Malia Ann, who was born in 1998[12] and Natasha ("Sasha"), born in 2001.
[13] They lived in Chicago, but moved into the White House on January 20, 2009.
Obama promised his daughters that the family would get a dog if he was elected president.
In April 2009, Senator Ted Kennedy, the brother of former President John F. Kennedy, gave Obama one of his dogs, a Portuguese water dog named Bo.
Obama has a half sister who is a teacher in Hawaii.
His father died from a car accident in Africa.
His mother died of cancer.
His maternal grandmother died just before Obama won the election to become President.
Obama became President of the United States on January 20, 2009.
The United States was battling a tough recession.
He asked Congress to spend an extra $787 billion ($787,000,000,000) to try to end the recession.
He called the plan the stimulus bill.
The stimulus bill funded many road projects, gave money to schools, gave tax credits to many Americans, and funded many science and research projects.
He continued the financial bailout that George W. Bush started, giving billions of dollars to car companies and banks so that they would not go bankrupt.
He signed an act written by Barney Frank and Chris Dodd which would regulate Wall Street (the financial industry) to try to prevent another recession like this from happening again.
Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which would bring health care reform to the United States, which he said would change the system so that more people can afford health care.
In foreign policy, Obama made a plan to slowly withdraw troops from Iraq, ending the War in Iraq by the end of 2011, while adding more troops to Afghanistan to help the United States win the War in Afghanistan.
He also decided that the USA should help in the war against Libya.
He has said several times that he wants to improve U.S. relations with the Muslim world.
Obama received the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize on October 9, 2009.
[14]  He noted that his efforts were humble, but he donated the prize money to several charities.
Though his popularity was very high (around 70% approval) when he entered office, his approval ratings fell to 45% percent during the year of 2010.
He received much criticism from Republicans, conservatives, libertarians, and members of the Tea Party because they believe that the federal government is becoming too big and spending too much money and that his programs are not the best for the country.
With rising economic deficits (the amount of money the government borrows each month) under his administration, he called for taxes to be increased on the rich.
He criticized his Republican opponents for wanting to cut welfare benefits for the poor rather than raising taxes to help pay down the debt.
He also signed the Don't Ask Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 in 2010, allowing openly gay men and openly lesbian women in the armed forces.
Obama reduced US participation in the Iraq War and continued the war on terror which resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.
Obama started a no-fly-zone policy on the Libyan civil war that ended in October 2011 with the killing of Muammar al-Gaddafi.
On May 9, 2012, he became the first sitting US President to openly support legalizing same-sex marriage.
On December 14, 2012, after the school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut occurred, Obama had said, "We're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics".
On December 21, 2012, Obama and his White House staff observed a moment of silence because of the school shooting in Connecticut.
On December 21, 2012, Obama nominated John Kerry for United States Secretary of State during his second term.
[15][16][17] Kerry was sworn in on February 1, 2013.
Before his second term began and still continues, there has been debating of guns because of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut that happened on December 14, 2012, as well as shootings in the past.
He took his second term inauguration oath in the White House, privately (only his family members could see) on January 20, 2013.
Obama was inaugurated for a second term on January 21, 2013 (January 20, 2013 fell on a Sunday) in the United States Capitol, that inauguration was viewed to the public.
He visited South Africa on late June 2013.
Prior to visiting South Africa, he visited Senegal.
He visited Robben Island, where Mandela was imprisoned.
He did not meet with Nelson Mandela.
The United States government shutdown occurred on October 1, 2013.
On October 17, 2013, Obama signed a bill which ended the United States government shut down.
Obama awarded several people, including former U.S. President Bill Clinton and media mogul Oprah Winfrey for the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.
He has awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to many people, such as Stephen Hawking, Sandra Day O'Connor, Chita Rivera, Loretta Lynn and George H. W. Bush.
On December 5, 2013, he gave a four and a half minute speech of Nelson Mandela after Mandela's death was announced.
On December 9, 2013, he departed Washington, D.C. to go to South Africa for Mandela's memorial service.
On December 10, 2013, Obama spoke at the memorial service of Nelson Mandela in Soweto, South Africa.
On April 4, 2011 Obama declared that he would stand for re-election for a second term in 2012 in a video titled "It Begins with Us" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission.
[18][19][20] He was officially nominated for his party's Presidential choice on September 6, 2012.
Mitt Romney was officially nominated as his opponent by the Republican party on August 30, 2012.
While the election results were very close, Obama easily won the electoral college votes he needed to win a second term.
[21] Obama and Romney spent more than $2 billion on advertising during the election campaign.
[21]
The start of his second term in 2014, had a few setbacks.
With the NSA, people were upset at the Obama Administration that the government was possibly listening to their phone calls.
His party (the Democrats) also lost the Congressional elections.
Because of disagreements between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, neither side is getting anything done and Obama has resulted in using his Executive Order (his power as president) to help reform things like the immigration system.
He's also supported increasing the minimum wage, requiring women to be paid the same as men at the same job and has called for the first 2 years of college to be fully government-funded for students who study full-time and get good grades.
After the death of Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace him on March 16, 2016, but the nomination expired because the senate refused to hold a vote for him.
The September 11 attacks (also called 9/11),[nb 1] were four terrorist attacks against the United States.
They all happened on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001.
The attacks killed 2,996 people, including the 19 attackers,[2] making it the deadliest terrorist attack in history.
[3] They caused more than $10 billion in damage to infrastructure.
[4][5] They were carried out by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda.
[6][7][8] They used passenger airplanes to destroy famous buildings by flying the planes into them.
There were two attacks in New York City and one in Arlington, Virginia.
The fourth attack did not work and the plane crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The buildings attacked were the World Trade Center's twin towers in New York City, and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.
The fourth plane crashed in an empty field in Pennsylvania before it could reach its target in Washington, D.C. That target was either the White House or the United States Capitol.
[9] After the event, the United States government said the people who had done the attacks were close to the terrorist group al-Qaeda.
The first of the four planes to take off was American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767-200ER.
It was 159 feet (48 m) long and 16 feet (4.9 m) wide.
It had two aisles.
The plane made daily flights between Boston and Los Angeles.
When it took off at 7:59 a.m. on the morning of the eleventh, it carried only 81 passengers in its 158 seats.
Forty-seven minutes later, it crashed into the North Tower at 440 miles per hour (710 km/h).
It was carrying 9,717 gallons of jet fuel, 14,000 fewer than it was able to carry.
United Airlines Flight 175, also a Boeing 767-200ER, was the second.
Like American Airlines 11, it was scheduled to fly from Boston to Los Angeles.
When United 175 took off at 8:14 a.m., it was even lighter than the American flight: Only 56 of 168 seats were filled.
When it crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center at 9:03 a.m., traveling 540 miles per hour (870 km/h), it had 9,118 gallons of fuel in its tanks.
This crash was broadcast live on many television channels worldwide that were already showing the North Tower burning.
[10]
American Airlines Flight 77 was the third plane to take off.
It was a Boeing 757-200.
It left Washington, D.C. at 8:20 a.m. going to Los Angeles.
It was two-thirds empty, with 58 passengers in its 176 seats.
It was carrying 4,000 gallons of fuel, less than the 11,500 gallons it could carry.
It crashed into the Pentagon at 9:37 a.m., ­flying at 530 miles per hour (850 km/h).
The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was also a 757-200.
It was traveling from Newark, New Jersey to San Francisco.
It was scheduled to leave at 8 a.m., but was delayed for 42 minutes.
When it finally took off, it carried only 37 ­passengers in its was 182 seats.
It had a little over 7,000 gallons of fuel.
At 10:03 a.m, it crashed at 560 miles per hour (900 km/h) into an empty field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
All of the 246 people on the four planes died in the crashes.
19 terrorists were also killed in the attacks.
Both towers of the World Trade Center caught on fire after the crashes.
The South Tower (2 WTC) burned for 56 minutes before it fell and was destroyed.
The North Tower (1 WTC) burned for 102 minutes before it also fell.
As the towers fell, parts of the towers hit other buildings around them.
It is believed that because of this damage, a third building, 7 World Trade Center (7 WTC), fell at 5:20 p.m.
Many other buildings in the area were damaged badly and had to be demolished later, leaving the whole World Trade Center complex destroyed.
2,602 people died at the World Trade Center.
The plane that hit the Pentagon hit the ground just as it hit the western side of the building.
It then crashed through three of the five "rings" that make up the Pentagon.
The crash killed 125 people in the Pentagon.
The United States government paid an average of $1.8 million to the families of the victims of the attacks.
[11]
There were 2,996 people who died in the attacks.
They included firefighters and police officers trying to save the other people.
They also included the 19 attackers who were all killed.
The attacks also led to the United States Department of Homeland Security being created, which protects the country from terrorist attacks.
Many conspiracy theories have appeared which say that certain people in the United States government knew about the attacks, or even made them happen.
These have been said to be false by the government.
After the attack, the United States blamed Al-Qaeda, which the U.S. thought was a terrorist group.
President George W. Bush said he would start a "War on Terror".
He meant that the United States would do more things to try to stop terrorism in the future.
Bush said this was meant to protect Americans and their property from terrorists.
For example, the American government would be reorganized.
Security and control in public places was made stronger, especially at airports.
Americans were told every day whether there was a serious threat of terrorism.
(This was done by giving a color for the day.
Red meant there was a high risk, green meant a low risk, and there were many levels in between.)
The War on Terror also led to real wars.
The leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, lived in the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
The United States told the government of Afghanistan, called the Taliban, to turn bin Laden over to them.
The Taliban would not do this.
The leader of the Taliban, Mullah Muhammad Omar, demanded to see proof from the United States government.
If proof was not given, Mullah Omar said that he would not hand over bin Laden.
President George W. Bush said that he did not need to provide proof.
[12] The United States then went to war against Afghanistan.
The Taliban was removed from power, a new government was put in power, and a new president was chosen by the people of Afghanistan.
While this was happening, the United States government changed in a few ways.
The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
Before 9/11, security at American airports was provided by the airlines.
The TSA made it the government's job to provide airport security.
New officers were hired by TSA to work at airports and to fly on planes as air marshals.
The TSA also provides security on American trains and subways.
A new Department of Homeland Security was also created.
It became their job to protect Americans and their property inside the United States.
When this department was created, the TSA moved from the DOT to Homeland Security.
After defeating the Taliban, President George W. Bush thought the US should invade Iraq.
He believed that Iraq helped terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda.
He said he had evidence that Iraq was also making weapons of mass destruction.
He sent Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations to show them some of the evidence.
In March, 2003, the United States began its invasion of Iraq.
(Four other countries also took part, including the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, and Denmark.)
The government of Iraq was overthrown, and the people of Iraq elected a new government.
No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq.
On May 2, 2011, United States Navy SEALs killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who led the September 11, 2001 attacks, among other terrorist attempts.
The United States of America (often called the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic made of fifty states and a federal district.
The forty-eight contiguous states and Washington, D.C., the capital district, are in central North America, between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
These forty-eight states are bordered by Canada to the north and Mexico to the south.
Two states are not next to the other forty-eight states.
The state of Alaska is in the northwest of the continent.
Canada is east of Alaska.
Russia is west of Alaska across the Bering Strait.
The state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific.
The United States also owns several territories, or insular areas, in the Caribbean and Pacific.
The United States is 3.79 million square miles (9.83 million km²).
There are about 306 million people living in it.
This makes the United States the third or fourth largest country by total area, and third largest by land area and by population.
The United States is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations.
This is because of large-scale immigration from many countries.
[17] The U.S. economy is the largest national economy in the world, with an estimated 2016 gross domestic product (GDP) of US$ 18.57 trillion (23% of the world total based on nominal GDP and almost 21% at purchasing power parity).
[18][19]
The nation was founded by thirteen colonies of Great Britain, which was along the Atlantic seaboard.
On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which stated their independence from Britain and their formation of a cooperative union.
The rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence.
[20] The Philadelphia Convention adopted the current United States Constitution on September 17, 1787; its ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a strong central government.
The Bill of Rights, comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791.
In the 19th century, the United States acquired land from France, Spain, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Russia, and annexed the Republic of Texas and the Republic of Hawaii.
Disputes between the agrarian South and industrial North over states' rights and the expansion of the institution of slavery provoked the American Civil War of the 1860s.
The North's victory prevented a permanent split of the country and led to the end of legal slavery in the United States.
By the 1870s, the national economy was the world's largest.
The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a military power.
In 1945, the United States emerged from World War II as the first country with nuclear weapons, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and a founding member of NATO.
The end of the Cold War left the United States as the sole superpower.
The country accounts for approximately 50% of global military spending and is the leading economic, political, and cultural force in the world.
[21]
The official date of the founding of the United States is July 4, 1776, when the second Continental Congress, representing the 13 British secessionists colonies, signed the Declaration of Independence.
However, the structure of the Government had a big change in 1788 when the Articles of Confederation were replaced by the Constitution of the United States.
The date on which each state adopted the Constitution tends to be taken as the date on which the state became part of the Union.
As the nation gained new territory, it was divided on the subject of slavery.
The northern states of the country opposed the slavery of African Americans and many of them had already been abolished.
The southern states of the country said they needed slaves.
The economy of the north grew industrially, while the south was growing on an agricultural basis.
Following this division of economy and politics, the southern states decided to create a new independent nation, propitiating the beginning of the war by the northern states who did not recognize the right of secession.
After the Civil War between the Confederate States (south) and the Union (north), slavery was abolished throughout the American territory.
After the Spanish–American War in 1898, the United States was slowly acquiring an ever-increasing influence in the world.
After the first World War, and then the second, American influence on aspects such as economics, science, technology, and culture grew to new levels.
Because of the Cold War and the political, ideological and social controversy that resulted, the role of military and international affairs grew in politics at that time.
Important events were also held at that time, such as the civil rights movement in the 1960s, and the landing of Apollo 11 on the Moon in 1969.
Under President George H. W. Bush, the country took on a global dominant role worldwide, as in the Gulf War (1991).
The longest economic expansion in modern American history, from March 1991 to March 2001, spanned the presidency of Bill Clinton and the dot-com bubble.
[22] A civil lawsuit and a sex scandal led to his impeachment in 1998, although he managed to finish his period.
The 2000 presidential elections, one of the most competitive in American history, they were settled by the Supreme Court: George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, became president, even though he gained fewer votes than his opponent Al Gore.
[23]
On September 11, 2001, the terrorists of the Al-Qaeda group attacked the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City (which were destroyed) and the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., in a series of attacks that ended the life of nearly three thousand people.
In response, the Bush administration launched the "War on Terror."
At the end of 2001, U.S. forces invaded Afghanistan, toppled the Taliban government and destroyed Al-Qaeda's training camps.
Taliban insurgents continue to fight a guerrilla war.
In 2002, Bush began to push for a regime change to take place in Iraq.
[24][25] With NATO's lack of support and without a clear UN order for military intervention, Bush organized the coalition of the willing; The coalition forces quickly invaded Iraq in 2003 and toppled the statue of dictator Saddam Hussein.
The following year, Bush was re-elected as the most voted president in an election.
The United States is a federal republic.
The federal government of the United States is set up by the Constitution.
There are three branches.
They are the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judicial branch.
State governments and the federal government work in very similar ways.
Each state has its own executive, legislative, and judicial branches.
The executive branch of a state government is led by a governor, instead of a president.
The executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law.
Members of the U.S.
Electoral College elect a president who is the leader of the executive branch, as well as the leader of the armed forces.
The president may veto a bill that the Congress has passed, so it does not become a law.
The President may also make "executive orders" to ensure that people follow the law.
The president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day actions of government.
For example, Department of Commerce makes rules about trade.
The president chooses the heads of these departments, and also nominates federal judges.
However, the Senate, part of the legislative branch, must agree with all of the people the president chooses.
The president may serve two 4-year terms.
The legislative branch makes laws.
The legislative branch is called the United States Congress.
Congress is divided into two "houses".
One house is the House of Representatives.
The Representatives are each elected by voters from a set area within a state.
The number of Representatives a state has is based on how many people live there.
Representatives serve two-year terms.
The total number of representatives today is 435.
The leader of the House of Representatives is the Speaker of the House.
The other house is the Senate.
In the Senate, each state is represented equally, by two senators.
Because there are 50 states, there are 100 senators.
The President's treaties or appointments of officials need the Senate's approval.
Senators serve six-year terms.
The Vice President of the United States serves as president of the Senate.
In practice, the vice president is usually absent from the Senate, and a senator serves as president pro tempore, or temporary president, of the Senate.
Representatives and senators propose laws, called "bills", in their respective houses.
A bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group, known as a committee, which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house.
If one house votes to pass a bill, the bill then gets sent to the other house; if both houses vote for it, it is then sent to the president, who may sign the bill into law or veto it.
If the president vetoes the bill, it is sent back to Congress.
If Congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds majority, the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president.
Under the American system of federalism, Congress may not make laws that directly control the states; instead, Congress may use the promise of federal funds, or special circumstances such as national emergencies, to encourage the states to follow federal law.
This system is both complex and unique.
The judicial branch is the part of government that interprets what the law means.
The Judicial Branch is made up of the Supreme Court and many lower courts.
If the Supreme Court decides that a law is not allowed by the Constitution, the law is said to be "struck down" and is no longer a valid law.
The Supreme Court is made up of nine judges, called justices, who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
One of these justices, called the chief justice, heads the court.
A Supreme Court justice serves until he or she dies or resigns (quits in the middle of his or her term).
When that happens, the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left.
If the Senate agrees with that choice, the person becomes a justice.
If the Senate does not agree with the president's choice, then the president must nominate someone else.
Famous court cases such as Marbury v Madison (which was decided in 1803) have firmly established that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter of the United States Constitution and has the power to strike down any law that conflicts with it.

The United States of America consists of 50 states, 5 territories and 1 district (Washington D.C.).
States can make laws about things inside the state, but federal law is about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries.
In some areas, if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws, people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more.
Each state has a constitution of its own, different from the federal (national) Constitution.
Each of these is like the federal Constitution because they say how each state's government is set up, but some also talk about specific laws.
The federal and most state governments are dominated by two political parties: the Republicans and the Democrats.
There are many smaller parties; the largest of these are the Libertarian Party and the Green Party.
People help in political campaigns that they like.
They try to persuade politicians to help them; this is called lobbying.
All Americans are allowed to do these things, but some have and spend more money than others, or in other ways do more in politics.
Some people think this is a problem, and lobby for rules to be made to change it.
Since 2017, the president is a Republican, and Congress is also Republican-controlled, so the Republicans have more power in the federal government.
There are still many powerful Democrats who can try to stop the Republicans from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country.
Also, members of a party in power do not always agree on what to do.
If enough people decide to vote against Republicans in the next election, they will lose power.
In a republic like the United States, no party can do whatever they want.
All politicians have to argue, compromise, and make deals with each other to get things done.
They have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes.
The USA's large cultural, economic, and military influence has made the foreign policy of the United States, or relations with other countries, a topic in American politics, and the politics of many other countries.
The United States is the fourth biggest country in the world by land area.
Only Russia, Canada and China are bigger.
The U.S's geography varies a lot and includes:
The climate varies along with the geography, from tropical (hot and wet in summer, warm and dry in winter) in Florida to tundra (cold all year) in Alaska.
Large parts of the country have warm summers and cold winters.
Some parts of the United States, like parts of California, have a Mediterranean climate.
The United States conquered and bought new lands over time, and grew from the original 13 colonies in the east to the current 50 states, of which 48 of them are joined together to make up the contiguous United States.
These states, called the "lower 48", can all be reached by road without crossing a border into another country.
They go from the Atlantic east to the Pacific in the west.
There are two other states which are not joined to the lower 48 states.
Alaska can be reached by passing through British Columbia and the Yukon, both of which are part of Canada.
Hawaii is located in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and is so far from the rest of the US that it can only be reached by airplane.
Washington, D.C., the national capital, is a federal district that was split from the states of Maryland and Virginia in 1791.
Not part of any US state, it used to be in the shape of a square, with the land west of the Potomac River coming from Virginia, and the land east of the river coming from Maryland.
In 1846, Virginia took back its part of the land.
Some people living in DC want it to become a state, or for Maryland to take back its land, so that they can have the right to vote in Congress.
The United States consists of sixteen lands that are not states, many of which are colonial territories.
None of them have any land borders with the rest of the US.
People live in five of these places, which are de facto American:
The Philippines was a possession of the United States.
Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and other Pacific island nations were governed by the United States as a United Nations "Trust Territory".
All of these places have become independent: the Philippines in 1946, Palau in 1947, and Micronesia in 1986.
The U.S. armed forces has bases in many countries, and the U.S. Navy's base at Guantanamo Bay was rented from Cuba after that country had a Communist revolution.
All the states are divided into administrative subdivisions.
Most of them are called counties, but Louisiana uses the word "parish," and Alaska uses the word "borough."
There are many cities in the United States.
One city in each state is the state capital, where the government of the state meets and the governor works.
This city is not always the largest in its state.
For example, the city with the most people living in it is New York City in New York State, but the state capital is Albany.
Some other big cities are Los Angeles, California; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; Miami, Florida; Indianapolis, Indiana; Las Vegas, Nevada; Houston and Dallas, Texas; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massachusetts; Denver, Colorado; St. Louis, Missouri and Detroit, Michigan.
The United States has a capitalist economy.
The country has rich mineral resources, with many gold, coal and uranium deposits.
Farming makes the country among the top producers of, among others, corn (maize), wheat, sugar, and tobacco.
America produces cars, airplanes, and electronics.
About 3/4 of Americans work in the service industry.
The top 15 trading partners in terms of total trade are:

80% of the people in the United States descend from European immigrants.
Many people are descended from Germany, England, Scotland, Ireland, Africa, and Italy.
[27]  13% of the people in the United States are African-American.
Most of them descend from the African slaves that were brought to America.
Asian-Americans make up only 5% of the population in America but make up a bigger portion in the west coast.
For example, in California, Asian-Americans make up 13% of the population of that state.
Hispanic-Americans or people of Latin origins make up 15% of the nation.
The original peoples, called Native American, American Indians, or Amerindians and Inuit (Eskimos) are a very small group.
11% of the people in the United States are foreign born.
18% speak a language other than English at home.
For people 25 and older, 80% are high school graduates while 25% have a bachelor's degree or higher.

It identified 43 million German-Americans, 30.5 million Irish-Americans, 24.9 million African-Americans, 24.5 million English-Americans, and 18.4 million Mexican-Americans.
The social structure of the United States has a big range.
This means that some Americans are much, much richer than others.
The average (median) income for an American was $37,000 a year in 2002.
However, the richest 1% of Americans have as much money as the poorest 90%.
51% of all households have access to a computer and 41% had access to the Internet in 2000, a figure which had grown to 75% in 2004.
Also, 67.9% of American families owned their homes in 2002.
There are 200 million cars in the United States, two for every three Americans.
The debt has grown to over $21,000,000,000,000.
There are many different religions in the U.S.  Statistically, the largest religion is Christianity, including groups such as Catholicism, Protestantism and Mormonism.
Other religions include Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Unitarian Universalism, Wicca, Druidry, Baha'i, Raelism, Zoroastrianism, Taoism and Jainism.
[28] Religions which were founded within the United States include Eckankar, Satanism and Scientology.
Native American religions have various animistic beliefs.
The United States is one of the most religious countries in the Western World, and most Americans believe in God.
The number of Christians in the U.S. has gone down.
86.2% called themselves Christian in 1990 and 78.4% said this in 2007.
The others include Judaism (2.3%), Islam (0.8%), Buddhism (0.7%), Hinduism (0.4%), and Unitarian Universalism (0.3%).
Those who have no religion are at 16.1%.
There is a large difference between those who say that they belong to a religion and those who are members of a religious body of that religion.
[29]
Doubts about the existence of a God, gods or goddesses are higher among young people.
[30] Among the non-religious population of the U.S., there are deists, humanists, ignotic, atheists, and agnostics.
[31]
The United States does not have an official language, the United States Congress has considered officially designating English as such for many years,[32] since it is the most used language, and the language in which the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution are written.
38 states out of 50 have English as the official language.
Spanish has increased in usage in certain sectors of society, due to a flow of immigrants—especially from Mexico and Cuba.
French is also a main language in parts of Louisiana because France once owned the area as a colony.
American popular culture goes out to many places in the world.
It has a large influence on most of the world, especially the Western world.
American music is heard all over the world, and American movies and television shows can be seen in most countries.
[33]
The American flag is made up of 50 stars on a blue background, and has 13 stripes, seven red and six white.
It is one of many symbols of the United States like the Bald Eagle.
The 50 stars represent the 50 states.
The red stands for courage.
The blue stands for justice.
The white represents peace and cleanliness.
The 13 stripes represent the 13 original colonies.
